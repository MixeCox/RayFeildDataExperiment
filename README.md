# RayFieldDataExperiment
# Task 1.1: This dataset was selected because it provides 15-minute and 1-minute intervals of solar energy generation and weather data, respectively. The time span is 2 years of data and contains weather and energy generation data at individual energy sites identified to be at one of 5 campuses. It can support energy workflows that depend on information about energy flow, amount, and flow disruption, like anomaly detection, and forecasting based off of determined typical values.
# Task 1.2: The solar energy generation data has 4 columns and 273194 rows. The weather data has
# Task 3.2: The worflow pain point we're solving is the job of an Energy Manager in monitoring energy production through summaries and visualization and anomalies via IsolationForest.
# Projects: Dashboard: Energy production "score" and live plot of KwH energy generation - Upload: CSV upload, processing screen, and review page with summary of energy production (API) and visual from matplotlib and notices of any recent anomalies.
