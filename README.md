# RayFieldDataExperiment
# Task 1.1: This dataset was selected because it provides 15-minute and 1-minute intervals of solar energy generation and weather data, respectively. The time span is 2 years of data and contains weather and energy generation data at individual energy sites identified to be at one of 5 campuses. It can support energy workflows that depend on information about energy flow, amount, and flow disruption, like anomaly detection, and forecasting based off of determined typical values.
# Task 1.2
